# TODO: 

## The big stuff

– return to element form when clicking on said element (instead of overlay with generated props form)
– setup forms for all elements
– some elements (e.g. quote) make sense to be editable in the wysiwyg – for most returning to element form makes more sense (e.g. chart, survey, etc)
– decide on serialisation logic
– decide on where the code should live
– clean up publish logic // atm very DIY (needs BE involvement)

## Smaller things

– fix normalisation (e.g. image captions / autonormalisation broken since refactoring)
– fix disableBreak behaviour
